It’s amazing to see how their building style has changed over time and it’s a reminder to all of us that persistence is one of the keys to making us do great things.\n"},{"downloads":[{"title":"McWorld","md5":"7d2b72b60c20722cf04d10c40abe2af5","url":"metro-goenitz.mcworld"}],"id":"1436","title":"Metro Goenitz","images":[{"url":"s01.jpg"},{"url":"s02.jpg"},{"url":"s03.jpg"},{"url":"s04.jpg"},{"url":"s05.jpg"},{"url":"s06.jpg"},{"url":"s07.jpg"},{"url":"s08.jpg"},{"url":"s09.jpg"}],"text":"Metro Goenitz is large city currently undergoing building developments.

It was originally going to be our first major project, but like most small teams back then, it fell apart and no one really had the drive to work on it. It took me a little while to get back into it, but when I did I went hard. Basically in the time that I really went hard on building, I built the majority of the actual map. Then I got busy with school this past year and I had to put this on hold. Then when you gained the ability to change from creative mode to survival mode, plus plug PE was created I was finally able to fill the chests effectively. Then more recently this summer I did all of the busy work and built walls, the sky, and tested the map multiple times. Now finally after three years I have finished the mega project that has been through so many ups and downs!

Fight your friends to the death, the last man standing wins!\n\n• Team Deathmatch\n\nBegin at your team's base and fight it out to kill the enemy! Each team has 15 lives all together, if you kill an enemy their team's life points will go down by 1. If the other team reaches 0/15 lives, You win!\n\n• Bomb Defusal\n\nBegin in your team's base. One random criminal will be selected to carry the 'C4 Bomb'. Their job is to place it at the enemy's base (Blue Circle)! Once placed there will be a 30 second countdown until the C4 explodes! The criminals must protect the bomb whilst the cops have to defuse the bomb (Stand on the bomb for around 3-5 seconds, A beeping noise can be heard when you defuse the bomb!). The criminals can also win by killing all the cops. The cops can also win by killing all criminals or killing the player holding the C4 (The C4 holder's name is announced at the start of the game).\n\n• Take-Over\n\nBegin in even teams at your home bases. Kill the other players to get them on your team! You can also die and switch teams so watch out! The game ends when all players are on one team!\n\n• Infection\n\nBegin with 1 Cop and all the other players as Criminals. All criminals must survive for 4 minutes.

Run to the enemy base to capture the flag and return it to your base!\n\n\n# Maps\n\n• Sandstorm\n\nA very good arena for Team minigames as it has a lot of open spaces and buildings. This arena is build with a theme of Red/Orange war zones. There are loads of spawn points and many chests!\n\n• Festival\n\nAn extremely good map for Take-Over or minigames that require open spaces! There are a lot of houses and a large mid. This theme was based off of the first 'Minigame Festival' maps! There are limited spawn points and a small amount of chests make the game even harder!\n\n• Warzone\n\nA very complex arena using a lot of mechanics and underground hallways. Run through the hallways of the hidden underground base or battle with your friends on the top of the base! This arena is very good for Infection and Bomb Defusal!\nLoads of updates are still to come including more modes and maps! Keep and eye out little cloudies!\n\n• Spacebound\n\nA space themed map with multiple hallways that make a great game of infection or take-over!\n\n• Apocalyptic (NEW!)\n\nSurvive and Thrive in this city!

During the time of the pirate uprising, the town was cut off from supplies as pirates began raiding and sinking supply and trading ships. Consequently, the small town was facing starvation until one day, a skylander ship crash landed on the island. \n\nThe people of Garberg were initially afraid of the skylanders, but a man named Rocar saw an opportunity and made a deal with the sky captain to repair their skyship in exchange for supplies and a temporary trade agreement. After the skyship had been repaired, the sky captain came back as promised and brought not only more goods to trade, but three other skyships, one of which belonged to the skylord. The skylord was quick to present a treaty to the settlement which he then took to the human capital. After the capital agreed to the treaty, the skylanders then helped to destroy the pirate uprising, therefore ensuring that trade and prosperity would reign between the two nations for many decades to come. \n\n# Creators\n\n• Original Map: lemonny3663\n• Ported by: souhail3907\n\nThere are two versions available for download.\n\n• Simple Shaders applied version\n• Original version\n"},{"downloads":[{"title":"McWorld","md5":"3cd46d249b031156499dbb485475b628","url":"formulaboat.mcworld"}],"id":"674","title":"Formula Boat","images":[{"url":"s01.jpg"},{"url":"s02.jpg"},{"url":"s03.jpg"},{"url":"s04.jpg"},{"url":"s05.jpg"},{"url":"s06.jpg"},{"url":"s07.jpg"},{"url":"s08.jpg"},{"url":"s09.jpg"}],"text":"Formula Boat is a spin-off of Formula One.

The map makes use of an addon which turns the snowball into a paintball that deals 1 heart of damage per hit and has an infinite range, meaning, it goes exactly where you throw it.\n\nHow to play?\n\nTo play you will need to be at least two players but more players are preferable. Type the following text command to give paintballs to all players: /give @a snowball 300 0\n\nSplit up into four different teams: blue, green, red and yellow and then enter the map.\nType /spawnpoint and then make a countdown from 5 before dropping down into the arena.\nAs soon as you enter the paintball arena the battle begins. The winner is the last player (or team) alive.\n\nYou can also play this map King of the Ladder style. Use the same instructions as above but give also players enchanted golden apples.\n\nThe objective for a King of the Ladder type of gameplay is to get to the highest platform and stay there for the longest time during a period of five minutes."},{"downloads":[{"title":"Resource Pack","md5":"ccc2c7fdc58dbae01c4d6dc30e3780f3","url":"fnaf-6-statue-pack.mcpack"}],"id":"1036","title":"FNAF 6 Statue Pack","images":[{"url":"s01.jpg"},{"url":"s02.jpg"},{"url":"s03.jpg"}],"text":"* This pack only works with Minecraft PE version 1.2.6 or later.\n* Please make sure Minecraft version is 1.2.6 or higher before downloading.\n\nThis is a resource pack which replaces the heads and skulls in-game with statues.\nAll statues are of Animatronics in the FNaF series.\nIt’s definitely a new way of decorating your builds but it could also be quite useful for adventure and/or horror maps.\n\n# How to activate it\n\n• Download and install the resource pack\n• Activate the pack you installed in Settings (Settings > Global resources)\n"},{"downloads":[{"title":"Behavior Pack","md5":"a89beb941d4217fff18f927c771574fd","url":"thundereggv2.mcpack"}],"id":"358","title":"Thunder Egg Add-on (v2)","images":[{"url":"s01.jpg"},{"url":"s02.jpg"},{"url":"s03.jpg"},{"url":"s04.jpg"}],"text":"In this add-on, the egg is turned into a weapon which can be used for spawning lightning.

Works on both mobs and players. Lingers on the ground for several seconds.\n• Levitation Ball (Bottle o’ Enchanting): Causes the mob or players to start levitating.\n• Poisonous Ball (Ender Pearl): A linger potion effect which lingers for several seconds. Can cause damage to multiple mobs at the same time.\n• TNT Ball (Bow): Spawns a primted TNT block.\n• Lightning Ball (Egg): Summons lightning bolts.\n\nLet’s have a look at some of the magic wizard balls. In the first image you can see what happened right after I threw an Explosive Ball.\n\nThe Health Ball is really useful in case you need to heal a large group of players (or mobs) at the same time. You can return to it later too as it lingers for a long time.\n\nThe Levitation Ball can be used as a weapon to quickly subdue a monster or a player. It can also be used on yourself if you need to get past some type of obstacles.\n\nThe Poisonous Ball causes a lingering potion effect which lasts for several seconds. Any mob or player which steps into the green ring will be poisoned.\n\nThe Lightning Ball can be used for summoning a lightning bolt.
